                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p> I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small growing family.  My
                            journey into tech started with a degree in journalism.  As I started sharing my writing
                            online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there.  I was hooked
                            and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.
                        </p>    
                    </div>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>
                            That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut.  When I learned how to
                            build my first website, I realized I found somehting that gave me the freedom & versatility
                            I was looking for in my work.  Now I've made a full switch to front-end 
                            development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean,
                            elegant code.

                        <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>

                        <p> My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that
                            the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>

                        <p> I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on.  I focus on keeping my
                            CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.

                        </p>

                        <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>

                        <p>
                            You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage
                             that is pixel-pefect match.
